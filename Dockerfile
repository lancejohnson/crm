# Build the Groundwork CRM image.

# Replaces the old pipeline, which mutated the live production backend
# container and `docker commit`ed it as the next gwN tag. That stacked one
# ~32 MB layer per deploy onto the previous image and never removed anything
# (layers are append-only), so by gw228 the image was 256 layers / 14 GB with
# 227 historical copies of the frontend bundle still inside it. Every build
# here starts from the same fixed base instead, so the image stays ~30 layers
# and ~3 GB no matter how many times we deploy.

# Last upstream tag whose published image actually contains the crm app --
# upstream's image CI is broken for everything after v1.67.0.

# LAYER ORDER IS LOAD-BEARING. `yarn build` is ~40s and by far the most
# expensive step, so nothing that changes independently of the frontend may
# appear above it. crm/ (the Python app) is copied AFTER the build for exactly
# that reason: it accounts for roughly a third of our commits, and when it sat
# above the build every backend-only deploy paid the full vite cost for a
# bundle that could not have changed. Now those deploys hit the cache and skip
# the build entirely.
#
# Nothing is inherited from a previous build, so a file deleted from the repo
# cannot survive into production. The old pipeline shipped source with
# `docker cp`, which has no delete semantics -- an abandoned module (and a
# debug script holding a real buyer's PII) sat in prod for over a year.
#
# The fork pins its own vite/plugin versions (Vite 8 + Rolldown, see below), so
# node_modules can no longer be inherited unchanged from the base image. Keyed
# on package.json + yarn.lock ONLY and placed above the source copy, so it is
# cached on every build where dependencies did not change -- which is nearly all
# of them. When it does miss, expect ~150s instead of ~20s.

# Vite 8 (Rolldown) rather than the Vite 5 upstream still ships. Roughly halves
# the bundle step: measured 36s -> 18s best case, ~40s -> ~25s median, and it is
# markedly more consistent under load. Upstream frappe/crm is still on vite
# ^5.4.21 and frappe-ui's develop only reached vite ^7, with no Rolldown work in
# flight, so this will not arrive on its own.
#
# vite-plugin-pwa MUST stay >= 1.x here. The 0.21.x we used to pin writes to the
# `bundle` variable in generateBundle, which Rolldown ignores -- the build still
# succeeds but silently drops registerSW.js and manifest.webmanifest, so the
# self-destroying service worker never registers and users keep being served
# stale bundles from an old SW. That is the exact bug selfDestroying exists to
# prevent, and it is invisible unless you diff the output.
COPY --chown=frappe:frappe frontend/ ${APP}/frontend/

# This used to have to seed `socketio_port` into sites/common_site_config.json
# first: src/socket.js imported that JSON at BUILD time, and during a docker
# build there is no sites volume, so rollup died with "socketio_port is not
# exported by". socket.js now derives the socket URL from window.location
# instead, so nothing reads that file at build time and the workaround is gone.
#
# vite.config.js sets emptyOutDir:false so a build adds new content-hashed
# chunks rather than deleting the ones open tabs are still importing. Retention
# across deploys is handled by the shared crm-assets volume, not here -- see
# docker-compose.yml and the publish step in build_image.sh.

# ---- final stage --------------------------------------------------------
# Only the BUILT OUTPUT crosses over, so the 1.59 GB yarn-install layer never
# ships: 5.89 GB -> 3.74 GB. Costs nothing in build time -- measured 28s vs 28s
# on a frontend change and ~2s vs ~2s on a backend-only change, because the
# expensive layers are identical and BuildKit caches them either way.
#
# CAVEAT: node_modules in this final image is the BASE's (vite 5), not the
# vite 8 tree the bundle was built with -- that stayed in the builder. Nothing
# at runtime uses it and verify_no_drift.py excludes it, but a `yarn build` run
# by hand INSIDE a running container would silently use vite 5. Build images,
# don't build in containers (which is the entire point of this Dockerfile).
