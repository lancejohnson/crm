/**
 * A lead's comparable sales on a map.
 *
 * Ported from the LeadMarket comps view, with the one change that matters: that
 * app can only draw an ESTIMATED subject location (iSpeedToLead hides the address
 * until you buy the lead), so it plots the centroid of the comp cloud. We own
 * these leads, so this centers on the REAL geocoded parcel and the comps arrange
 * themselves around it.
 *
 * The fade is the point. A sale from last month tells you far more about today's
 * value than one from last year, so opacity carries recency and the eye lands on
 * the comps that actually count without reading a single date.
 *
 * Filters arrive PRE-SET around this property (recent + similar), because an
 * unfiltered two-mile dump is not a comp set. The server picks the tightest tier
 * that still yields a usable number and tells us whether it had to loosen; when it
 * did, we say so instead of quietly showing houses that are nothing like this one.
 * Touching any control switches to explicit mode — from then on the server runs
 * exactly what is on screen, even if that matches nothing.
