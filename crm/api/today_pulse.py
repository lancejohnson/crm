"""Intraday Today-board pulse — posted to the Acq channel every 30 minutes.

The 5am standup DM says what the day looks like; the Today board is where the
setters work it; this is the half-hourly heartbeat in between, so pace is visible
while the day can still be changed rather than at 6pm when it can't. It posts to
the team channel rather than a DM so everyone in acquisitions is looking at the
same number.

One message carries four things:

  * **delta** — cards resolved since the last pulse
  * **rolling total** — where the day stands, as a progress bar
  * **pace** — how much of the working day has elapsed vs. how much of the board
    is resolved, i.e. how many cards over or under we are right now, plus what's
    left against the hours left
  * **talk time** — Quo minutes in the window

Talk time is here deliberately. Cards-per-half-hour on its own punishes exactly
the behaviour we want: a setter deep in a 20-minute conversation with a motivated
seller resolves fewer cards than one dialing voicemails, and a bare "+1" would
read as a rebuke for doing the job right. The renderer therefore leads with the
conversation whenever the window was quiet on cards but busy on the phone.

Definitions are reused, never re-derived:

  * board state / totals — `CRM Today Item`, the same rows `today_board` serves
  * call attribution — `caller` -> `receiver` -> `User.custom_quo_number`, the
    exact chain `activity_progress._call_events` uses, so the pulse and the Team
    Activity report cannot disagree about whose call it was
  * business days — `daily_standup.is_business_day`

The delta window is a **watermark**, not a fixed 30 minutes: it runs from the last
successfully posted pulse to now. A skipped or failed slot therefore folds its
cards into the next message instead of dropping them, so the deltas across a day
always sum to the day's resolved total.
