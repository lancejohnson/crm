"""Real-time driver for CRM Sequence steps (single-driver model).

The sequence engine (`CRM Sequence Runner Core`, a Server Script) advances ONE
step per call. Server Scripts run in a RestrictedPython sandbox with no
`time.sleep` and no delayed enqueue (no rq_scheduler), so they can't honor
seconds-level waits. This module runs in a normal background worker (not
sandboxed): it sleeps the real wait between steps and reuses the engine for the
actual per-step action, so the send logic stays in exactly one place.

Single-driver model — `drain()` is the ONLY thing that advances an enrollment,
and `job_id="seqdrain:<enrollment>"` (deduped via is_job_enqueued, which covers
QUEUED *and* STARTED jobs) guarantees at most one drainer per enrollment ever
runs. That is what makes the cron + drainer handoff race-free: there is never a
second driver that could fire the same step. The old blanket `CRM Sequence
Runner` core-cron is DISABLED so it can't act as a second driver.

Two enqueue paths, both funnelling to the same per-enrollment job_id:
  - `enqueue_for_lead` (CRM Lead doc-event) -> `drain_lead` -> drain, for the
    instant burst the moment a lead enrolls (low latency).
  - `drain_due` (1-min scheduler in hooks.py) -> drain, the backstop that keeps
    sub-minute follow-on steps (e.g. rapid texts after a longer wait) firing
    without being rounded up to the cron tick.

Performance: drainers SLEEP, so they run on a DEDICATED queue (`seqdrain`) with
its own worker container — a sleeping drainer never blocks the main background
queue (emails, ring-alerts, contact sync). Waits longer than LONG_WAIT_SECONDS
are handed back (the drainer returns; `drain_due` re-enqueues it once it is due),
so a single drainer holds its worker for at most ~LONG_WAIT_SECONDS. For higher
lead volume, scale the drain-worker (replicas) or move to delay-based scheduling
(rq_scheduler) to avoid sleeping entirely.
