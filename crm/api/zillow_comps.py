"""Refresh ISTL comps against Zillow — area search + per-pin lookup.

The pooled `CRM Comp` index is ISTL's RentCast-derived last *asks*, frozen when
the marketplace lead was scraped. It ages. This module is the freshness layer:

  A. Circle search for every RecentlySold in the last 2 years AND every
     ForSale (`coordinates=lon lat,diameter`, diameter = 2× radius miles).
     Pages through `totalPages`; a window over RapidAPI's 800-result ceiling
     binary-splits on price (devproppy `fetch_all_zillow_properties`). Cached 7 days per rounded
     center so two leads on the same block share the spend.
  B. `/property` on the nearest stale ISTL pins (capped) so a house ISTL still
     has as an 8-month-old ask can pick up the sale Zillow recorded last week.

Street-address `/search` returns `{zpid}` only. ZIP is the wrong geography.
`polygon` is a box (corners sit at 2.83 mi). `coordinates` is the true circle
(measured: `d=4` → solds out to 1.99 mi). `dateSold` is epoch-ms.

Every path degrades softly: a Zillow outage or a quota-reserve hit leaves the
ISTL set untouched. BatchData stays the last resort for a truly empty map.
