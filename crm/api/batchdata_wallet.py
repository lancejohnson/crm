"""BatchData wallet: what is left, what we spent, and a shout when it runs dry.

Why this exists
---------------
BatchData is PREPAID, and when the wallet empties nothing announces it. The
features just stop: "Fetch Tax Info" 403s in the rep's face, and the comps map's
BatchData fallback silently returns nothing for the leads that have no comps of
their own — which are exactly the leads that needed it. Both wrote a line to the
Error Log, which nobody reads.

Found live on 2026-08-21: the wallet was at **$0.26** with 24 failures already
logged over the previous week, including reps' tax pulls failing that morning.
Nobody knew.

Two free endpoints do all the work here (`/wallet/balance` and
`/wallet/consumption-report` are both $0.00), so checking costs nothing and can
be done as often as we like.

What a dollar buys, so the numbers below mean something: `/property/search` and
`/property/lookup/all-attributes` bill **$0.03 per RECORD RETURNED** (not per
call), skip-trace $0.07. The comps fallback takes 10 rows, so it is $0.30 a lead;
a tax pull is $0.10.

BOTH API keys share ONE wallet
------------------------------
`batchdata_api_key` (broad) and `batchdata_comps_api_key` (comps-only) are two
tokens on the same balance — verified, both report the identical figure to the
cent. There is no separate "comps budget", so one runaway job starves every
BatchData feature at once.

Reading the numbers honestly
----------------------------
The consumption report is the only per-day history available, and it is the right
tool for "what did we spend and on what". But its totals do NOT reconcile with
the wallet: for 2026-08-14..18 it reported ~$185 of API spend while the balance
moved only -$35.75. So it is reported as BatchData's own figure, and the balance
is reported separately as ground truth, rather than blending the two into one
number that is quietly wrong.
