"""Groundwork custom leads dashboard.

A focused, single-call dashboard answering three questions:
  1. New leads per day over the selected range (+ a total).
  2. Status changes for leads — how many entered vs. exited each stage.
  3. New leads broken down by source.

Status-change data comes from the `CRM Status Change Log` child table that the
Lead doctype writes to on every status change (see crm_lead.py -> add_status_change_log).
Each completed row means: the lead entered `from` at `from_date` and left it for
`to` at `to_date` — i.e. one "exited `from`" event and one "entered `to`" event,
both stamped at `to_date`.

# Status Change Report
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# A richer, drill-downable view of how leads move between statuses. Two lenses:
#
#   cohort  (default) — pick the leads CREATED in the range, then show where
#                       each one went. Answers "what happened to the leads
#                       created yesterday?". Started = the status each lead
#                       began in; Ended = where it is now.
#   flow    (the GIF) — pick every transition that HAPPENED in the range.
#                       Started/Ended are full-population snapshots at the
#                       window edges; Entered/Left are the flows during it.
#
# Both lenses satisfy the same identity per stage S:
#     Ended[S] = Started[S] + Entered[S] - Left[S]   (Net = Ended - Started)
# so the table always reconciles.
#
# Everything is derived from `CRM Status Change Log` (one completed row per
# transition: lead left `from` for `to` at `to_date`) plus each lead's current
# `status` and `creation`. Creation into a status is NOT a log row, so we
# reconstruct each lead's initial status from the earliest log row's `from`
# (falling back to the current status when a lead never changed).

# split out — per Lance, so we can see who's responding — as unique leads AND
# total actions, with call talk time alongside.
#   calls       — CRM Call Log rows referencing a CRM Lead (`type` Outgoing/Incoming)
#   texts       — Quo Message rows referencing a CRM Lead (`direction` Outgoing/
#                 Incoming; custom doctype managed by the ops repo, may be absent)
