"""Who owns which phone line, and which provider a row came from.

This exists because Telnyx is coming and Quo is not leaving on the same day. The
plan is to run both in parallel, and the plan's own warning is the reason this
module is written BEFORE any Telnyx traffic exists:

    every report must union both providers or it silently under-counts.

The Team Activity report, the intraday pulse, the standup and the lead-owner
backfill all answer "whose call was that?" by walking `caller` -> `receiver` ->
the user's sending line. During parallel running, half the calls are invisible to
a chain that only knows about Quo — no error, just a smaller number that looks
plausible. That is the same failure family as the `reference_doctype` trap and
the incoming-`userId` trap, both of which cost weeks of wrong figures.

So: ONE place that knows which numbers belong to which people, across providers,
and ONE normaliser.

WHY LAST-10. There were NINE separate `_last10`/`_digits` helpers in this app
(activity_progress, sms, quo_contacts, do_not_contact, agreement_adopt,
call_transcript, investorlift_ingest, investorlift_2fa, lead_import) and they did
not agree: `activity_progress` and `today_pulse` matched a user's line by EXACT
STRING against `User.custom_quo_number`, so a line stored as "+16125551234" never
matched a call log carrying "6125551234". A number is the same number however it
was typed, and last-10 is what every other part of this codebase already settled
on.

CALLS ALREADY CARRY THEIR PROVIDER — and it is NOT the field the plan assumed.
The plan proposed re-stamping `telephony_medium` (every row says "Manual",
upstream's default). Measured on prod first: all 4,192 rows are
`medium = "Quo"`, `telephony_medium = "Manual"`. The ops webhook has been
writing `medium` since the mirror was built, so the discriminator exists, is
100% populated and is correct — no migration, no re-stamp, nothing to run.
Telnyx writes `medium = "Telnyx"` and every downstream reader works.
`telephony_medium` is read only as a fallback, because it is what upstream's own
telephony framework sets and a call placed through that path would carry it.

TEXTS have no equivalent, hence `Quo Message.provider` (ops:
setup_provider_columns.py). The doctype keeps its name: renaming one with 4,357
rows buys nothing a column does not.

Nothing here writes. It is deliberately a read model: the providers' own webhooks
own their rows.
