"""Ingest InvestorLift buyer-board rows into CRM Buyer + CRM Lead Buyer.

The buyer board lives at `investorlift.ai/deals/{property_id}` — a Next.js RSC app
with no REST API and a reCAPTCHA login, so it can't be crcommed like the admin API
(Tier 1). Instead an ops Playwright worker (`../frappe-crm-deploy`,
`scripts/investorlift_scrape.py`) loads a human-seeded session, reads the rendered
DOM per deal, and POSTs the parsed buyer rows here.

This endpoint is the CRM side: for each scraped buyer it upserts a global
**CRM Buyer** (deduped by email → phone) and a per-property **CRM Lead Buyer**
relationship (the Dispo-board row), resolving the lead from `il_property_id`. The
board's column becomes the `interest_stage`; type tags, verified, deal history,
direction, and last-active are mirrored on. Buyer↔us texts/calls are NOT ingested
here — once a buyer's phone is on a CRM Buyer, their Quo conversation already shows
in our own timeline.
