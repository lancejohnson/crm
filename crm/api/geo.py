"""Client for the redfin-scraper-api service (neighbourhood properties + parcels).

(The service was named groundwork-geo until 2026-08-31; same box, same port,
same endpoints — only the name changed, because the abstract one hid the fact
that it is the fleet's one and only Redfin scraper.)

The service is source-agnostic — it takes coordinates and knows nothing about a
CRM Lead. This module owns the mapping in the other direction: lead -> point,
and lead -> "warm the neighbourhood".

WHY WARM AT PURCHASE. A dense two-mile sweep is ~75s across ~49 upstream calls,
and enriching its parcels is ~45 minutes at 6.6/s. Neither can happen while a
rep waits on a page. So the work starts when the lead lands and the desk reads
whatever is ready — the same shape as the Zillow facts cache, one order of
magnitude slower.

Config-gated like `contract_parser_url`: with no `redfin_scraper_url` in
site_config every entry point is a no-op, so the app is safe to deploy before
the service exists and degrades quietly if it goes away. The pre-rename
`geo_service_url` key still works as a fallback so config and code never have
to move in lockstep.
