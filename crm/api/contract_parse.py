"""Parse a fully-signed contract into the lead's fields (Gemini, in-app).

Flow: DocuSeal fires → `crm.api.agreement.docuseal_webhook` refetches the
submission and saves the CRM Esign Agreement row → if the envelope is now fully
signed, `trigger_parse` enqueues `parse_agreement` on the `long` queue. The job
fetches the signed PDF from DocuSeal, hands the PDF itself (not extracted text)
to Gemini with a strict JSON response schema, and writes what came back through
`write_agreement_fields`. An hourly catch-up sweeps the last `CATCHUP_DAYS` for
anything signed while a worker was down.

History: this ran on the Mac mini for a month (a Funnel-exposed listener +
a one-shot `pi` run per contract). It was moved in-app 2026-09-07 because the
listener crash-looped for days after the ops checkout moved and a signed PSA
sat unparsed for hours. The CRM already held the field map, the validation and
the write path; the only thing on the mini was the model call, and Gemini is
already wired here for call review. `notify_mini` remains as a fallback ONLY
when `gemini_api_key` is absent.

Design points that are load-bearing:

* **The PDF goes to the model as a PDF.** Gemini reads the document natively,
  so no poppler/pdftotext is needed in the container, and a scanned or
  hand-built envelope (the adopted ones) still parses.

* **The model has no tools and returns only a schema-shaped object.** The
  contract text is semi-untrusted input; the prompt says so, and the write
  path validates every value (`_coerce`) and rejects unknown field names.

* **The field map lives here** (`PARSE_FIELDS`). Adding a field is a change in
  THIS file: prompt, schema and validation are all derived from it.

* **Writes go through `doc.save()`, not `db.set_value`** — deliberately the
  opposite of the tax-pull/first-call pattern. We *want* the Version row: it's
  what puts "changed Acq Price from … to …" on the lead's activity timeline,
  and that timeline is the entire audit trail for this feature.

* **One agreement parses once** (`parsed_at`). An amendment arrives as its own
  agreement row, so it parses on its own and correctly overwrites the price or
  closing date — while a re-delivered webhook for an already-parsed contract
  can't clobber a human's later correction. A failed parse is stamped too
  (`parse_status=error`), so a broken PDF is not re-billed every hour;
  `parse_now(agreement, force=1)` is the deliberate retry.

Cancellations are deliberately NOT parsed: the DocuSeal sync already tracks the
document, and clearing real fields on an LLM read of a cancellation is the one
failure here that loses data instead of just being wrong.
