"""Generate `dispo_buyers.json` -- the CRM's copy of "who buys here?".

Run from an UP-TO-DATE checkout of ../leadmarket (which owns the scraping; the
repo was called istl-buyer when this script was written, hence the flag name):

    python3 crm/api/data/build_dispo_buyers.py --istl ~/Projects/Groundwork/leadmarket

leadmarket resolves the three differently, and the difference is why this script
exists rather than the CRM importing its modules:

  * New Western is keyed on (city, state) with a (county, state) fallback -- its
    dataset already ships that way, so it is copied across almost verbatim.
  * KeyGlee is keyed on **county FIPS**, and building FIPS needs a Zillow county
    CSV that leadmarket caches and the CRM has no reason to carry. So each
    KeyGlee territory's FIPS list is expanded HERE, once, into (county, state)
    keys. The CRM then does one kind of lookup for every buyer and ships no FIPS
    table, no Zillow dependency and no scraper.
  * ezREIdispo is FIPS too, and expanded the same way. It carries a RANK rather
    than a status, because their list is ordered and that ordering is the only
    thing on it we could not have worked out ourselves.

The county keys keep istl-buyer's `C`/`N` flag (independent city vs county)
because collapsing them is a real error: Virginia has both Richmond City and
Richmond County, Maryland has Baltimore City and Baltimore County, Missouri has
St. Louis city and St. Louis County. They are different places and a buyer can
work one and not the other.

This is a SNAPSHOT. All three open and close markets, so re-run it after
`python -m src.newwestern refresh` / `python -m src.keyglee refresh` /
`python -m src.ezrei rebuild` upstream. The generated file records where each
part came from and when.
