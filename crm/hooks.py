# Cache
# ------------------

#: Cache prefixes that must SURVIVE `bench clear-cache`.
#:
#: `build_image.sh` ends every deploy in `clear-cache`, and Frappe's
#: `clear_cache()` deletes *every* key for the site except the prefixes listed
#: here. That is right for state derived from our code -- hooks, doctype meta,
#: server scripts and rendered website pages all go stale the moment a build
#: ships. It is wrong for these: they are PAID third-party responses, and
#: Zillow's answer about a house does not change because we deployed.
#:
#: Measured on prod: a deploy was taking **175 area circles + 22 pin lookups**
#: with it -- ~300 RapidAPI calls, on a key shared with istl-buyer's ZIP job --
#: which the Today-board prewarm then spent the next ~40 minutes buying back.
#: On a day with several deploys that was the single largest consumer of the
#: plan, and it bought nothing: the data thrown away and the data re-fetched
#: were identical.
#:
#: CONSEQUENCE, and it is why this is a deliberate trade rather than a free win:
#: the deploy wipe was invalidating these caches by ACCIDENT. With it gone, the
#: version numbers already baked into the keys -- `AREA_CACHE_VERSION`,
#: `PIN_CACHE_VERSION`, `DETAIL_CACHE_VERSION` -- are the ONLY invalidation
#: path. That is the mechanism they exist for, and it is surgical where the wipe
#: was blanket, but it means anyone changing the SHAPE of a cached row has to
#: bump the matching version constant. A deploy no longer papers over forgetting.
#:
#: TTLs are unaffected (area 7d, pin 30d, detail 30d), so nothing lives forever.
